head - it is used to do with tab name 

body - this is what it will be shown in website. 

h - headings upto h6 

p - paragraph //For each new tag there is always a new line. To overcome this situations we use span for continuous line even if we use new tag of span. 

p*3 = it will open 3 p code 3 times. 

inside p tag lorem_n (n = 1,2,3) - random words 

b/strong - bold 
i/em - italic 

br(no closing tag used) - new line 

a - is used to open any existing website
 - ex :  <a href="https://www.google.com">Go to google</a>
if you want that whenever you click that link it open in new tab so use: 
 - target="_blank" 
 - <a href="https://www.google.com"target="_blank">Go to google</a>

if you want to open your html file in website so do / and you will get options: 
 - <a href="/tut4.html"target="_blank">tutorial 4</a>

ul is used to make some markings and inside that we use li for line 
inside ul/ol you can so some other markings as well such as circle, much more. 
 - <ul type="circle">
        <li>This is my list item</li>
   </ul>

For tables: 
 - table tag inside that we use thread tag and inside that we use tr tag and inside that we use th tag: 
 - thread for headings of table which is in bold. 
 - tr is used for row 
 - th data 
 - However, in data side of table instead of thread we use body and instead of instead of th we use td. 
Ex: 
<table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>name</th>
                <th>age</th>
                <th>number</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>

        <body>
            <tr>
                <td>Divy</td>
                <td>21</td>
                <td>7041</td>
            </tr>
	</body>
</table>

For form: 
 - use form tag and inside that we can use input tag and inside that there are many types such as date, email, number, 
   text, radio, checkbox, textarea, select inside select we use options tags and inside that we can choose which we want to be selected as default. 
<form action="">
  <div>
            <label for="car">Car: </label>
            <select name="myCar" id="car">
                <option value="Indi" >Indigo</option>
                <option value="Indi" selected>swift</option>
            </select>

        </div>
        <div>
            Write about yourself: <br><textarea name="myText" cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            Email: <input type="email" name="myEmail">
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            Date: <input type="date" name="mydate">
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            Email: <input type="email" name="myEmail">
        </div>
	<div>
            are you eligible: <input type="checkbox" name="" id="" checked> //checked means by default it will be checked marked. 
        </div>
        <div>
            Check: Male <input type="radio" name="myEmail" >  Female <input type="radio" name="myEmail">
        </div>
        <div>
            <input type="submit" value="submit now">
            <input type="reset" value="Reset Now">
        </div>
        
    </form>

 - there is also a reset tag inside input where we don't need any input name same in submit. 
	<div>
            <input type="submit" value="submit now">
            <input type="reset" value="Reset Now">
        </div>

 - label tag is used to when you click on label you directly go to typing stage of text. 

<label for="name">Name</label>
        <div>
            <input type="text" name="myName" id="name">
        </div>

if you want to to do border than we have to use style inside anything like a , span, p tag: 

<a style="border: 2px solid green;">
    this is new
    <a style="border: 2px solid red;">This is paragraphs</a>
    <span style="border: 2px solid blue;">this is span</span>
    <span>This is also span</span>
    </a>

Class is for giving a properties to many elements. So, a class can have many elements and elements can have many class. 
id is used to recognize any element. There can be only single id to any element. There shouldn't be any duplicates.  

span.class will give span with  class. 
ex: 
<span class="class"></span>

span#id_name will give span with id for ex i have wrote span#main. 
<span class="" id="main"></span>

div.redBg.blackborder.anotherclass: 
This will give me something like this - <div class="redBg blackborder anotherclass"></div>

same as above: 
span.myclass.myclass2.myclass3: 
<span class="mtclass myclass2 myclass3"></span>

&nbsp; - will give space as if you write <p> this is   para </p> then this extra spaces won't be allowed in order to do so we have to use nbsp;. 

there are multiple ways to write some marking:

&lt - it will give < marking. 
&gt - it will give > marking.
&pound - it will give something like this £
&copy - it will give me something like this © 

detail tag is used to give and expand options. So, if you click on arrow it will expand the content. 
Inside details there is also a summary tag. In that we can show the content and with that we can expand it. 
And after the summary tag whatever content is there it will be shown when expand.
